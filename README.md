Conclusion of the problem:

When problem size increased run time will be decreased.
For example ;
When we have 3 candidate facilities and 3 of them will opened, and also we have 20 points CPU:13.0
When we have 4 candidate facilities and 3 of them will opened, and also we have 20 points CPU:12.0
When we have 5 candidate facilities and 3 of them will opened, and also we have 20 points CPU:11.0

When you hold the number of points and number of facilities will be open is stable and the only thing change is increased candidate location number, CPU time of the code will be decreased.

When we have 5 candidate facilities and 3 of them will opened, and also we have 10 points CPU:13.0
When we have 5 candidate facilities and 3 of them will opened, and also we have 15 points CPU:11.0
When we have 5 candidate facilities and 3 of them will opened, and also we have 25 points CPU:23.0

When you hold the number of facilities will be open and number of candidate facility number is stable and the only thing change is increased number of points, CPU time of the code will be increased.

As a result,when we increased the candidate location for facilities CPU time will be decreased but, when we increased the number of points CPU time of the code will be increased.
